## ‚úÖ Key Excel Skills Demonstrated

### 1. üîó Cell Referencing & Absolute Referencing

- Utilized **relative referencing** to dynamically copy formulas across rows and columns.
- Applied **absolute referencing** (e.g., `$A$1`) to fix specific cells in calculations, ensuring consistent results in formulas like `SUMIF`, `VLOOKUP`, and custom reports.
- Example:
  ```excel
  =SUMIF($A$2:$A$100, D2, $B$2:$B$100)
