## 🧠 Key Skills & Techniques

### 🧩 **Formulas & Functions**
I applied a variety of Excel functions to clean, transform, and analyze the data:
- **SUM, SUMIF, AVERAGE, AVERAGEIF** – Used to calculate total sales, commissions, and average performance metrics.  
- **DATE, MONTH, YEAR** – Extracted components for time-based analysis (e.g., monthly or yearly sales trends).  
- **UNIQUE** – Identified distinct customer IDs and product categories.  
- **VLOOKUP** – Performed lookup operations to retrieve related data efficiently.  
- **SWITCH** – Created conditional logic to classify customers or product types dynamically.  
- **IFERROR** – Managed missing or inconsistent values for smoother analysis.

### 🔍 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Standardized column headers and formatted numeric/date values.  
- Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistencies in categorical data.  
- Ensured calculated fields such as *Total Sales* and *Commissions* matched logical business formulas.  

### 📊 **Data Analysis**
- Filtered and sorted data to identify **top 10 products**, **most valuable customers**, and **sales trends by month/year**.  
- Built **PivotTables** to summarize sales by:
  - Product Category  
  - Gender and Generation  
  - Year and Month  
  - Commission by Year  
- Performed **year-over-year comparisons** to track performance growth between 2023 and 2024.  
- Created **dynamic reports** to segment data by customer demographics and product types.  

### 📈 **Visualization**
Designed a collection of **PivotCharts** and **interactive visuals** to communicate insights effectively:
- **Column Charts** – Showed monthly sales trends and yearly comparisons.  
- **Pie Charts** – Illustrated the distribution of sales by gender, generation, and product type.  
- **Line Charts** – Highlighted year-over-year sales and commission changes.  
- **Bar Charts** – Ranked products and categories by total sales volume.  
- Applied **conditional formatting** to emphasize high-performing areas and outliers.
